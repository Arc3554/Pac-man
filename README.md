# Pacman-In-Java

This project is the final project of the course **JAVA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT**. I collaborated with [Rockyco](https://github.com/Rockyco) and [Arc3554](https://github.com/Arc3554) together to finish the project. 

#### This year, 2020, is 40th anniversary of the game!!!


## Algorithm

The ghosts use two algorithms to catch up with pacman.

* Blinky, Pinky: Use vector to make the decision of choosing next step.
* Inky, Clyde : Use A* search algorithm to construct the path.

Our algorithm so powerful that few people can win the game XD.

## Start the game

Download the repo, and double click pacman.jar.
**Make sure your computer has installed java.**
